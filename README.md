# Daraz Scraper

This script uses `BeautifulSoup`, `requests`, and `selenium` libraries to scrape and extract mobile cover information from Daraz.pk.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
pip install selenium
```

Also, make sure you have ChromeDriver installed in your system.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Scraper.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment or any other suitable platform.
3. Run the notebook.
4. Uncomment the code blocks for inputs and modify the inputs if you want to change the query or number of items displayed.
